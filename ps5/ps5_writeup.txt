
Part A: im lazy to write right now

Part B:

    r^2 is less; curves are more tightly fit; and it supports our global warming more.
    this is cuz we have a much larger sample and so it'll be closer. Variance go down
    as sample size go up. 100 cities would make it even better. Cuz it's the mean of all of them.
    21 cities in same region would make the sample biased, however.

Part D.I:

    The high degree has the best R^2 (but not that good cuz there's too many points and polyfit just
    gives up lol), and physically the degree 20 one does best.

Part D.II

    so yea. obviously the linear model had the best root mean square error. Linear did the best cuz
    it's linear; more co2 more temperature and we are pumping co2 at a fairly linear pace. Obviously it's not going to
    be quadratic and suddenly crash down lol.

    The A.4.II data would have probably predicted something similar but with more error since that one had more error.

Part E

    For some reason, temperature variation is going down. I have no idea why nor ideas to improve it other than to say
    that the hypothesis was wrong! temperature variation is not going down!

    Maybe some cities are skewing the average but yeah i dunno
